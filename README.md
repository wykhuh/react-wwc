2. After installing node, install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
3. Install Git. https://git-scm.com/downloads

4. Get a Github account.  https://github.com

5. Install text editor Atom https://atom.io

### Create sample React app

Use create-react-app to create a basic React app. We will create a folder called `github-battle`

```
create-react-app github-battle

cd github-battle

```

Start the app.

```
npm start
```

Load this url in your browser.

```
http://localhost:3000
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see "Welcome to React"
